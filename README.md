# SpaceBattle

A 2d turn based space battle "simulator" based on [Begin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begin_(video_game))

Begin was one of the first PC games I played, and I can remember countless hours hunting Romulans, Klingons and Orion Pirates.
Here is my work-in progress version of a game in that genre, albeit quite different in many respects.

I think my version is quite over-complicated, but it is fun in its own way.

TODO:
- The console (command-line) version was meant as a stepping stone, and I would love to move the visuals to a more graphically rich system
- There are many missing features, including gravity wells.
- SO MANY PHYSICS BUGS
- OMG BALANCE

At this point it is little more than a curiosity, but if you are curious, feel free to check it out!
